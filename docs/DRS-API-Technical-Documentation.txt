1.0 Overview 
This  document  presents  the  details  for retrieving regulatory  and  guidance  documents  from 
Dynamic Regulatory System (DRS) by external applications. 
 
 
2.0 Scope 
The scope of this document is   to provide technical details of DRS API for external applications. 
 
2.1 Dynamic Regulatory System (DRS) 
DRS is a comprehensive knowledge center of regulatory and guidance material from the Office 
of Aviation Safety (AVS) and beyond. It provides one central location for aviation regulations 
and guidance materials. 
DRS combines numerous document types from a dozen repositories into a    single searchable 
application. The system includes pending, current and historical versions of all documents 
along with their revision history. And to ensure you have the most current documents, it is 
updated every 24 hours.

3.3 API Endpoints to Retrieve Documents  
 
The following API endpoints are used to retrieve document-related data from the Dynamic Regulatory 
System (DRS) for a specified document type. 
 
• The first API retrieves document metadata. 
• The second and third APIs use information returned from the first API to download document 
attachments or retrieve additional attachment details. 
• The fourth API allows metadata-based filtering in the request, returning only documents that 
match the specified criteria. 
 
 
3.3.1   Retrieve Document Metadata 
API URL -  1 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/< doctypeName> 
Method GET 
Request 
Parameters 
Header: 
{ 
“x-api-key” : “{key}” 
} 
Note: To request an API key, please visit the DRS API page in the DRS Help & Training section and 
click on "Request / Renew API Key", then follow the steps outlined. 
 
Input parameters: 
Path variable: doctypeName 
Request Parameters: offset(optional), docLastModifiedDate(optional), 
docLastModifiedDateSortOrder(optional) 
 
1. Use Document Type name as path parameter in the API URL. 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC 
2. Provide “offset” as request parameter. It   is   an optional field. The DRS API will 
return the first 750 documents by default if an “offset” is   not received in the 
request. If an offset is provided in the request parameter, the API skips the 
documents till the offset value and returns next 750 documents starting from 
the “offset value +1”. 
 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC (return first 750) 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC?offset=750 (Skip first 750, start 
= 751 and returns next 750) 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC?offset=1500 (Skip first 1500, start=1501 and returns next 
750) 
3. Provide “docLastModifiedDate” as request parameter. It   is   an optional field. This 
request parameter is used to retrieve documents added or updated after the 
requested date. 
The “docLastModifiedDate” value is   included in the DRS API response, but by 
default, the response data is not sorted by this date. Instead, documents are 
sorted according to the default sort order configuration of the DRS browse screen 
for that document type. The default sort order is detailed in the Metadata mapping 

DRS – API Technical Design Document 
Page 5 of 
 
 
 
spreadsheet available on the API help page. If a DRS API consumer needs to 
retrieve documents added or updated after a    specific date, they can use 
“docLastModifiedDate” as a filter in the API request parameter. 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC?docLastModifiedDate=2021-05-09T14:38:11.964Z&offset=0 (Return 
first 750 documents that have docLastModifiedDate    > 2021-05- 
09T14:38:11.964Z) 
 
 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC?docLastModifiedDate=2021-05-09T14:38:11.964Z&offset=750 (Skip 
first 750, start = 751 and return next 750 documents that have 
docLastModifiedDate > 2021-05-09T14:38:11.964Z) 
 
 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC?docLastModifiedDate=2021-05-09T14:38:11.964Z&offset=1500 (Skip first 
1500, start=1501 and returns next 750 documents that have docLastModifiedDate 
> 2021-05-09T14:38:11.964Z) 
 
 
4.    Include “docLastModifiedDateSortOrder” as a request parameter. This optional field 
allows you to retrieve documents sorted by their last modified date. Accepted 
values are “ASC” or “DESC.” 
 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC?docLastModifiedDateSortOrder=DESC&offset=0 (Return   first   
750 documents sorted by docLastModifiedDate descending) 
 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC?docLastModifiedDateSortOrder=ASC&offset=0 (Return first 750 
documents sorted by docLastModifiedDate ascending) 
 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/AC?docLastModifiedDate=2021-05- 
09T14:38:11.964Z&offset=0&docLastModifiedDateSortOrder=DESC 
(Return first 750 documents 
sorted by docLastModifiedDate descending that have docLastModifiedDate > 2021-
05-09T14:38:11.964Z) 
 
If this request parameter is not provided, the documents will be sorted according 
to the default sort order configuration of the DRS browse screen for that 
document type. 
 
      Note: To apply additional filters, please refer to the API URL -4

“documents” is  an  array  where  each  entry  represents  a  document  and  contains  a  list  of  
metadata  names  and  their  corresponding  values.  A  metadata  name  is  a  string,  and  its  
value can be of one of the following types: text, array of text values, or date. All metadata 
fields of type date will use the format YYYY-MM-DD. 
 The following details are common to all documents across all document types in DRS. 
docLastModifiedDate - The date and time (in UTC) when the document was last modified. 
This metadata field can be used as a request filter to retrieve documents that were added 
or updated after a specific date and time.

  "sortOrder": "DESC", 
  "documentFilters": { 
   "drs:status": [ 
    "Current", 
    "Historical" 
   ], 
   "drs:pmaNumber": [ 
    "PQ04418CE" 
   ], 
   "drs:pmaSupDate": [ 
    "2020-01-01", 
    "2025-07-31" 
   ] 
  } 
 } 
 
1. Use Document Type Name as Path Parameter 
Example: 
https://drs.faa.gov/api/drs/data-pull/PMA/filtered
 
 

DRS – API Technical Design Document 
Page 11 of 
 
 
 
2. Using the offset Parameter 
It   is   an optional field. The DRS API will return the first 750 documents by default 
if an “offset” is   not received in the request. If an offset is provided in the 
request parameter, the API skips the documents till the offset value and returns 
next 750 documents starting from the “offset value +1”. 
                Request JSON without offset (or with offset = 0): 
                {}  
                     Returns 750 documents. 
                        
            Request with offset = 750:  
                 { 
  "offset": 750 
    } 
                  Skips the first 750 documents and return the next 750 (starting from 751). 
3. Using the docLastModifiedDate Parameter. 
It   is   an optional field. This field is used to retrieve documents added or updated 
after the requested date. 
The “docLastModifiedDate” value is   included in the DRS API response, but by 
default, the response data is not sorted by this date. Instead, documents are 
sorted according to the default sort order configuration of the DRS browse screen 
for that document type. The default sort order is detailed in the Metadata mapping 
spreadsheet available on the API help page. If a DRS API consumer needs to 
retrieve documents added or updated after a specific date, they can use 
“docLastModifiedDate” as a filter in the API request body. 
   { 
                          "offset": 0, 
  "docLastModifiedDate": "2021-05-09T14:38:11.964Z" 
    } 
 Returns first 750 documents with docLastModifiedDate > 2021-05-
09T14:38:11.964Z.  
               { 
  "offset": 750, 
  "docLastModifiedDate": "2021-05-09T14:38:11.964Z" 
    } 
               Skip first 750 and return next 750 documents that have docLastModifiedDate > 
2021-05  -09T14:38:11.964Z 
 
4. Using the sortOrder Parameter. This optional field allows you to retrieve 
documents sorted by their last modified date. Accepted values are “ASC” or 
“DESC.” 
                   { 
           "offset": 0, 
                         "sortOrder": "DESC" 
    } 
                   Returns first 750 documents sorted by docLastModifiedDate in descending order. 
                 { 
            "offset": 0, 
                         "sortOrder": "ASC" 
                  }  
                 Returns first 750 documents sorted by docLastModifiedDate in ascending order. 
 
                   { 
  "offset": 0, 
  "docLastModifiedDate": "2021-05-09T14:38:11.964Z", 
                                          "sortOrder": "DESC" 
               }  
            Returns first 750 documents that have docLastModifiedDate > 2021-05-

DRS – API Technical Design Document 
Page 12 of 
 
 
 
09T14:38:11.964Z, sorted in descending order. 
If this request parameter is not provided, the documents will be sorted according 
to the default sort order configuration of the DRS browse screen for that 
document type. 
5. Using the documentFilters Parameter.  
      The documentFilters field is optional. It allows you to retrieve documents that 
match specific Metadata filters provided in the request. 
      Each filter is specified as a key-value pair, where: 
• Key = metadata field name 
• Value = array of filter values 
        Example: 
  { 
   "offset": 0, 
   "docLastModifiedDate": "2021-12-21T14:04:31.062Z", 
   "sortOrder": "DESC", 
   "documentFilters": { 
    "drs:status": [ 
     "Current", 
     "Historical" 
    ], 
    "drs:pmaNumber": [ 
     "PQ04418CE" 
    ], 
    "drs:pmaSupDate": [ 
     "2020-01-01", 
     "2025-07-31" 
    ] 
   } 
  } 
    
        This request will: 
• Return the first 750 documents 
• Only include documents with a docLastModifiedDate after 2021-12  -
21T14:04:31.062Z 
• Sort results by docLastModifiedDate in descending order 
• Filter documents that: 
 Have a drs:status of Current or Historical 
 Have a drs:pmaNumber value of PQ04418CE 
 Have a drs:pmaSupDate between "2020-01  -01" and "2025-07  -31" 
 
          
 
Rules for 
Using 
metadata 
filters in 
documentFilte
rs 
 
• Each metadata field must be passed as a list (array), even if only one value is 
provided. 
 "drs:status": ["Current"] 
 "drs:status": ["Current", "Historical"] 
 
• For date-type metadata fields, the array must contain exactly two values: 
 The first is the start date 
 The second is the end date 
 Format: YYYY-MM-DD 
        Example: 
        "drs:pmaSupDate": ["2020-01-01", "2025-07-31"] 
           

DRS – API Technical Design Document 
Page 13 of 
 
 
 
Rules for 
Using 
Keyword 
Search filters 
in 
documentFilte
rs 
• In addition to metadata fields specific to the selected document type, the filter also 
supports keyword search within document content. 
To enable keyword search, pass "Keyword" as the key and provide a list of terms to 
search for.              
      Example:  
  { 
   "offset": 0, 
   "documentFilters": { 
    "drs:status": [ 
     "Current", 
     "Historical" 
    ], 
    "Keyword": [ 
     "ASTM International", 
     "Shearography" 
    ] 
   } 
  } 
          The above request will filter documents that: 
 Have a drs:status of Current or Historical 
 Have documents that contain ASTM International or Shearography 
anywhere in the document content
 
 
 
Validation 
Rules for 
documentFilte
rs 
• Unsupported Filter Key: Metadata filter keys must be defined for the requested 
document type. Unrecognized or unsupported keys will cause the request to be 
rejected. 
• Maximum Number of Filters: The total number of filters must not exceed the 5. 
• Maximum Values Per Filter: Each filter can include multiple values but must not 
exceed the allowed 10. 
• Empty Filter Values: Filters with no usable value (null, empty, or whitespace-only) will 
be ignored. If all filters are empty after cleaning, the entire documentFilters section is 
treated as null. 
• Date Filter Format: Date filters must be a list of exactly two valid dates in YYYY-MM-
DD 
• Invalid Date Values: If either the start or end date is invalid or unpassable, the 
request will be rejected. 
• Invalid Filter Value Type: If the value is not an array, the request will be rejected. 
• Date filters must not be passed as plain strings. 
• Post-Cleaning Empty Filter: After removing null/empty values, if a filter has no values 
left, it will be skipped. If all filters become empty, the entire documentFilters section is 
removed from the request.
